# Hello-World API

The source code implements this microservice (A Go code test).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1. Linux OS - Ubuntu or Fedora is preferred.
2. git
3. Golang Setup locally on OS
4. Postman for REST API testing
5. Docker & Docker Compose

### Installing

This application can be setup locally in following ways:

#### Option A
```
go get github.com/govinda-attal/hello-world
```

#### Option B (Preferred) :heavy_check_mark:
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/
mkdir govinda-attal
cd govinda-attal
git clone https://github.com/govinda-attal/hello-world.git
```

### Application Development Setup

'Makefile' will be used to setup hello-world api quickly on the development workstation.

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/govinda-attal/hello-world
make install # This will go get 'dep' and use it to install vendor dependencies.
```

## Running Tests

### Unit tests

Sample BDD Unit tests are implemented using ginkgo and gomega. These unit tests are written for HTTP handler only.
Two Unit tests are written for this code test.

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/govinda-attal/hello-world
make test # This will run execute unit tests with ginkgo -r command
```

### Integration tests

This microservice achives given requirements with Golang and Postgres Database as backend. To keep this foot-print of this application minimum postgres db will execute within a docker container. Where as following backend microservice can be hosted within a docker container or local OS.

#### Option A: Docker Compose - Microservice and Swagger UI as docker containers (Preferred) :heavy_check_mark:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/govinda-attal/hello-world
docker-compose up -d # This will start Hello-World Microservice and Swagger-UI which will point to Hello-World microservice swagger definition.
```

Docker compose will orchestrate containers and they can be accessed from Local OS as below:
1. Microservice on :earth_asia: http://localhost:3000
2. Swagger-UI on :earth_asia: http://localhost:8080

#### Option B: Microservice is run in a docker container

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/govinda-attal/hello-world

make run # This will build the docker image for microservice and spin a container locally and the API is exposed on port 3000
```

#### Option C: Microservice is run locally on your OS

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/govinda-attal/hello-world

make serve # This will build the Microservice and run it locally and the API is exposed on port 3000 
```

### Simple tests

1. :earth_asia: http://localhost:3000/?name=X
2. :earth_asia: http://localhost:3000/?name=error

### Swagger UI to view and trial Microservice Open API

Post running command *docker-compose up -d* use browser to open :earth_asia: http://localhost:8080

## Cleanup

For containers orchestrated by Docker-compose
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/govinda-attal/hello-world
docker-compose down
docker image rm gattal/hello:1.0
```

In case when Microservice running locally as a Docker container
```
docker rm hello -f
docker image rm gattal/hello:1.0

```

In case when Microservice running locally
```
Press Ctrl+C on the terminal on which microservice was running.
```

To delete the source code for this microservice run :skull: cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ && rm -rf  govinda-attal :skull:
